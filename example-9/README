Example 9

Example 9 is an extension to example 2. The
input device is fixed, depending on a setting in the CMakeLists.txt
file. The output is either to the soundcard (default) or written out
as modulated FM stereo samples, either to a file or to a tcp address.

All callbacks are defined, most of them with an empty body.

See the file main.cpp for the command line options

Feel free to improve the program

The program in this form is used retransmit the sound of a selected
service in FM format, and it allows me to listen using old (antique)
radios.

Parameter setting:
-f select a file to which the fm encoded output is written, 192000 samples/second
-p -u select a port resp. an url to send the data to.

Note that the transmissionrate is 192000, so for a simple WiFi environment
it is too heavy.

The format on the tcp port is compatible with the format requested
by the hackrf-server, a simple server for - as the name suggestes -
the hackrf as "transmitter" (I am using a small piece of coax between
the hackrf and my favorite radio)

Note that the hackrf server is a separate program
