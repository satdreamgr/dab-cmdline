cmdline.py  is a simple command line interface for use with the dab library.
Since we need an interface file between the DAB library and the python
program, a CMakeLists.txt file is include with which a library can be
generated that includes the interface file.

Note: you need to have numpy and sounddevice installed

Normal way of creating such a library is
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DSDRPLAY=ON
   make
   cp ./libdab_lib.so ..
   cd ..
   python3 cmdline.py -g 80 -c 11C -p "Classic FM"

Replace SDRPLAY in -DSDRPLAY=ON by AIRSPY or RTLSDR if you prefer any of thee
devices.

Command line parameters (there is a default one for each)

	-d to specify the delay allowing the system to look for an ensemble
	-m the DAB mode, default Mode 1
	-g the gain, default 50 (on a scale 1 .. 100
	-a the soundchannel, default "default"
	-c the channel, default "11C"
	-p the program name, default "Classic FM"
	-l the latency, to be used in the portaudio handler, default 0.1

To keep things a little simple, the Python version of the command line
implementation of DAB does not use all callbacks, see the python file.
The callbacks that are supported are all included in the cmdline.py file,
most of them with an empty (or almost empty) body.
