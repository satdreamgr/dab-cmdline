Example 8

Example 8 is an extension to example 2. The
input device is fixed, depending on a setting in the CMakeLists.txt
file. The output, modulated FM stereo samples, are sent to the
selected soundcard. The samplerate is 192000 and the basic idea
is to add the output to some analog device that shifts the frequency
so that a real HF or VHF FM signal is available.

All callbacks are defined, most of them with an empty body.

See the file main.cpp for the command line options

Feel free to improve the program

The program in this form is used retransmit the sound of a selected
service in FM format, and it allows me to listen using old (antique)
radios.
It differs from example 9 is that here no assumption is made on the
actual transmitter.
