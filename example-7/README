Example 7

Example 7 is a simple command line version of the DAB software. The
input device is stdin, the output is either to the soundcard (default) or to a file
(-O option).

Other than example 1, it binds directly to the functionality implementing
the DAB decoding.

All callbacks are defined, most of them with an empty body.

See the file main.cpp for the command line options

Feel free to improve the program
