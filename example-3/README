Example 3

Example 3 is an example program, not using the library, but binding directly
to the functions implementing the dab decoding.
All callbacks are defined, most of them with an empty body.

In this version, we send the audio output directly to stdout rather than -
using portaudio - sending it to the soundcard.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>  NOTES <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
a. There is no rate conversion done, the pcm samples, as
   arriving from the mp2 or aac decoder are just passed on
   The pcmHandler has as one of its parameters the rate

b. If you want to pipe the output to e.g. aplay then be aware that
   there might be gaps. If a data fragment can not be decoded,
   no PCM samples are emitted. For aac these are segments of 24 msec
   In order to ensure a continuous stream of samples out
   you may define STREAM_OUTPUT (see CMakeLists.txt) file,
   in which case the samples are fed into a separate thread that
   will fill in gaps with values 0. Note however, that still
   no rate conversion takes place. While the Dutch services as
   as far as I know all 48000 samples/second, e.g. in Switzerland
   theu are not.

See the file main.cpp for the command line options.
I just tried to have the command line options similar to the
ones of example 2 (However, choises for audio output are obviously
not available).

Feel free to improve the program

Points to note:

bytesOut is a new callback function, a function that is called
from the tdc handler (and later may be from others as well)

The data parameter is a packet with a 4 byte header
byte 0 is 0xFF
byte 1 is 0x00
byte 2 is 0xFF
byte 3 is 0x00
byte 4 is the high byte of the 16 bit size
byte 5 is the low  byte of the 16 bit size
byte 6 is 0x00
byte 7 is 0 for packet type 0, 0xFF for packet type 1

Note that the lenngth is the length of the data part, so not taking the
header into account

The bytesOut function puts the data into a simple TCP server that can be 
read from port 8888 (depending on the configuration).
